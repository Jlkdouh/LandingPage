            <h5>A charcuterie board is an appetizer typically served 
                on a wooden board or stone slab, either eaten straight 
                from the board itself or portioned onto flatware. 
                It features a selection of preserved foods, 
                especially cured meats or pâtés, as well as cheeses 
                and crackers or bread.

            <h5>This Salmon Florentine is perfect for a 
                weeknight dinner. Tender, juicy, and flaky salmon with 
                a delicious creamy spinach sauce. A healthy salmon that 
                can be ready in just under 30 minutes.</h5>

            <h5>Juicy entrecote steak in rich sauce served with fried 
                potato slices. French dinner for two. And I truly believe 
                this steak and potatoes is a hearty meal for any man! Red 
                wine sauce steak with shallot is a simple and delicious 
                beef recipe for dinner.</h5>

            <h5>This dish is inspired by Argentina and all the wonderful beef 
                they produce and consume. In Argentina, beef is most often 
                just seasoned with salt and grilled to perfection over fire on 
                the 'Parilla'. However, marinades are often created with lemon 
                juice and a few herbs and as in this recipe, wine is sometimes 
                added.</h5>
